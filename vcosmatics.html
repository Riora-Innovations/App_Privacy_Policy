</ol>
<p>3.1 We may disclose your Personal Data to the following categories of recipients:</p>
<p>(a) to&nbsp;<strong>our group companies</strong>&nbsp;for purposes consistent with this Policy, and in particular, so that they may contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you where you have given your consent. We take precautions to allow access to Personal Data only to those staff members who have a legitimate business need for access and with a contractual prohibition of using the Personal Data for any other purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) to&nbsp;<strong>our</strong>&nbsp;<strong>third-party vendors, services providers and partners</strong>&nbsp;who provide data processing services to us, or who otherwise process Personal Data for purposes that are described in this Policy or notified to you when we collect your Personal Data.

<p>(f) to any other person if you have provided your prior consent to the disclosure.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> How we protect your privacy&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>4.1 We will process Personal Data in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Fairness</strong>: We will process Personal Data fairly. This means that we are transparent about how we process Personal Data and that we will process it in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>(b)<strong>&nbsp;Lawfulness</strong>: We will process Personal Data only on lawful grounds.</p>
<p>(c)<strong>&nbsp;Purpose limitation</strong>: We will process Personal Data for specified explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not process it in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes, unless permitted by applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>(d)<strong>&nbsp;Data minimization</strong>: We will process Personal Data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary to achieve the purposes for which the data are processed.</p>
<p>(e)<strong>&nbsp;Data accuracy</strong>: We take appropriate measures to ensure that the Personal Data that we hold about you is accurate, complete and, where necessary, kept up to date. However, it is also your responsibility to ensure that your Personal Data is kept as accurate, complete and current as possible by informing us promptly of any changes or errors. You should notify us of any changes to the Personal Data that we hold about you (e.g. a change of address).</p>
<p>(f)<strong>&nbsp;Data security:&nbsp;</strong>We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the Personal Data that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data.&nbsp; In particular, all data is protected according to the varying levels of risks through physical measures, such as secure areas, technical measures, such as encryption, and organisational measures such as employee security through vetting and supervision.</p>
<p>(g)<strong>&nbsp;Limited Retention:</strong>&nbsp;We keep your Personal Data in a form that allows us to identify you for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes for which we are processing your data and do not store your data for longer, unless we must comply with applicable laws.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Data storage, retention and deletion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>5.1 The Personal Data we collect from you is stored in our servers located in the United S</p>
<p>5.2 We retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>5.3 When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> International transfers of data</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>6.1 Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>
<p>6.2 Specifically, our Website servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your Personal Data, we may process it in any of these countries.</p>
<p>6.3 However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Policy. When transferring your Personal Data to Canada, we rely on the EU Commission's adequacy decision 2002/2/EC available&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32002D0002">here</a>. When transferring your Personal Data to the United States, we rely on the EU Commission's EU-US Privacy Shield decision (available&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2016.207.01.0001.01.ENG">here</a>) if the recipient is appropriately certified. In all other cases, we only transfer or make your Personal Data available to other entities of the V KOSMETIK group or to our third-party services providers in third countries where such transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and V KOSMETIK or the implementation of pre-contractual measures.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Profiling</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>7.1 In some instances, we may use your Personal Data in order to better understand your preferences and to provide customized products or services to you. However, we do not make any decisions based solely on automated processing of such data, which either produce legal effects that concern you or similarly significantly affect you.</p>

<p>(c) If we have collected and process your Personal Data with your consent, then you can&nbsp;<strong>withdraw your consent</strong>&nbsp;at any time.

<li><strong> What are cookies?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>2.1 Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use a mobile application.

<p>2.3 Cookies set by the websites or app owners (in this case, V KOSMETIK) are called "<em>first party cookies</em>". Cookies set by parties other than the website or app owner are called "<em>third party cookies</em>".&nbsp; Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or mobile application (e.g. advertising, interactive content and analytics).&nbsp; The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer or mobile device both when it visits the website or uses the mobile application in question and also when it visits certain other websites.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong> What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>5.1 Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").&nbsp; These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Website(s) or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.&nbsp; This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies,<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&nbsp;</span>to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.&nbsp; In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>

<li><strong> How can I control cookies?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>6.1 You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject specific cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences in your browser&rsquo;s settings.</p>
